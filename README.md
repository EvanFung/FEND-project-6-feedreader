Sixth project from the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree in <a href="https://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a>:

wrote a number of tests against a pre-existing application with Jasmine, to test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

### To run the application

### Udacity's instructions

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.
